# casper cogs

a set of cogs for [Red Discord Bot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot).

none of these are particularly configurable because i don't imagine anyone else
will actually use them. feel free to create issues/PRs if i'm wrong!

## cogs

- make sure chosen dates are actually valid for that month
- allow leaplings to pick between february 28th and march 1st as a backup option

### [wordle react](wordlereact/cog.py)
